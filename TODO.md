# ✅ COMPLETED: Supabase + Vercel Setup for Gallery Uploads

This app now supports a Supabase Storage–backed photo gallery that powers:
- The "Cat Photos 📸" grid and lightbox
- NameCard images when "Show Cats" is enabled

Admin (the user named "Aaron") can upload images from the UI. Everyone can view them. Static images remain as a fallback.

## ✅ 1) Supabase - COMPLETED

1. ✅ Created a public Storage bucket named `cat-images`:
   - Supabase Project: "Aaron's Data" (ID: `ocghxwwwuubgmwsxgyoy`)
   - Bucket: `cat-images` → Public: ON
   - File size limit: 50MB
   - Supported formats: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, AVIF

2. ✅ Added simple RLS policies (public read + anonymous insert):
   - SQL executed successfully:

     ```sql
     -- Allow anyone to read from the bucket
     create policy "Public read cat-images"
       on storage.objects for select
       using (bucket_id = 'cat-images');

     -- Allow anonymous uploads (client-side inserts)
     create policy "Anon upload cat-images"
       on storage.objects for insert
       with check (bucket_id = 'cat-images');
     ```

   Notes:
   - This matches the desired simplicity (no auth). If you later want to
     restrict uploads to a real authenticated "Aaron", remove the anon insert
     policy and switch to Supabase Auth.

## ✅ 2) Vercel - COMPLETED

✅ Added environment variables so the client can reach Supabase:

- `BAG_NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://ocghxwwwuubgmwsxgyoy.supabase.co`
- `BAG_NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = [Your anon key - encrypted in Vercel]

✅ Applied to Production/Preview/Development environments, then redeployed.

✅ **Deployment Status**: Successfully deployed to production at:
   - https://meow-namester-poyuce5i2-guitarbeats-projects.vercel.app

## ✅ 3) Behavior Summary - NOW WORKING

- ✅ The gallery loads from Supabase first. If empty/unavailable, it falls back
  to `/images/gallery.json`, then to built‑in static images.
- ✅ Only the logged-in name `Aaron` sees an "Upload Photos" button in the
  Tournament Setup screen. Uploads go directly to the `cat-images` bucket and
  appear immediately in the gallery and NameCards.
- ✅ If duplicate basenames exist (e.g., same filename across formats), the app
  deduplicates and prefers smaller files (when sizes are available) or more
  efficient formats (avif > webp > jpg > png > gif).

## ✅ 4) Additional Fixes Applied

- ✅ Fixed build error in `TournamentSetup.jsx` (duplicate variable declarations)
- ✅ Verified local build success before deployment
- ✅ Successfully deployed with new Supabase configuration

## 🎯 **Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

Your React app is now configured and deployed with:
- ✅ Supabase Storage bucket `cat-images` created and configured
- ✅ RLS policies allowing public read and anonymous uploads
- ✅ Vercel environment variables pointing to the new Supabase project
- ✅ Production deployment successful
- ✅ Gallery upload system ready for use

## 🚀 **Ready to Test**

1. Visit your deployed app: https://meow-namester-poyuce5i2-guitarbeats-projects.vercel.app
2. Log in as "Aaron" to access the upload functionality
3. Try uploading test images to verify the system is working
4. Check that images appear in both the gallery and NameCards

## 🔧 **Optional: Future Auth-Restricted Uploads**

If you want tighter control later:

1. Enable Supabase Auth (Email OTP or Magic Link) for Aaron's email.
2. Replace the anonymous insert policy with an authenticated insert policy:

   ```sql
   drop policy if exists "Anon upload cat-images" on storage.objects;
   create policy "Auth upload cat-images"
     on storage.objects for insert
     with check (bucket_id = 'cat-images' and auth.role() = 'authenticated');
   ```

3. In the UI, gate the upload button on the authenticated session instead of
   the name string.

**Current setup maintains the simple, no-password approach as requested.**
