# Environment Setup

## Backend Offline Issue Fix ✅ RESOLVED

The "backend offline" error has been fixed! The Supabase environment variables have been successfully configured.

## How It Was Fixed

1. **Identified the Issue**: The backend was showing "temporary fallback — backend offline" because Supabase environment variables were missing
2. **Used Vercel CLI**: Retrieved the production environment variables from the deployed Vercel project
3. **Fixed Backend Configuration**: Updated the backend API client to properly handle Supabase connections
4. **Environment Variables**: Successfully loaded SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY from the production deployment

## Current Status

✅ Backend connection: WORKING  
✅ Supabase client: CONFIGURED  
✅ Environment variables: LOADED  
✅ Application: RUNNING  

The application should now be fully functional without the "backend offline" error.

## Manual Setup (if needed)

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following content:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://glgmoelyqnbyavabjgyw.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_supabase_anon_key_here

# Alternative environment variable names (for compatibility)
SUPABASE_URL=https://glgmoelyqnbyavabjgyw.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_supabase_anon_key_here
```

### 2. Get Your Supabase Anon Key

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project (ID: glgmoelyqnbyavabjgyw)
3. Go to Settings > API
4. Copy the "anon public" key
5. Replace `your_actual_supabase_anon_key_here` with the actual key

### 3. Restart the Development Server

After creating the `.env.local` file:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Verify the Fix

The application should now connect to Supabase successfully and the "backend offline" error should be resolved.

## Alternative: Use Local Supabase

If you prefer to run Supabase locally:

1. Install Supabase CLI: `npm install -g supabase`
2. Start local Supabase: `supabase start`
3. Use the local URLs provided by the CLI

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure the `.env.local` file is in the project root directory
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the environment variable values
- Check the browser console for any additional error messages
- Verify your Supabase project is active and accessible
